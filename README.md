## Documentation

- Since this assignment had time constraints, I was only able to finish the desktop version of the home page. It took 4 hours to complete.
- All buttons/links on the site are static. No other pages/mobile responsiveness are complete.
- If I had more time, I'd work on making the buttons and nav links functional and then work on the other pages.
- If the assignment didn't require me to use Vanilla HTML/CSS, I'd prefer building it out using ReactJS to make certain sections and elements of the site reusable by making them modular. It'd have also ensured that the code is cleaner, readable and easy to maintain.
- The file tree is divided into `index.html`, `styles.css`, and an `assets` folder that has all the images sorted into sub folders based on the sections.
- The html and css is also well formatted and each section's code is separated using comments.
